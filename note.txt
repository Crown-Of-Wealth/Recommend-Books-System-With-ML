FIRST PROJECT EXPERIENCE
I had a series of hassles getting my environment right on VS Code, but Augustine came to my rescue.

After successfully setting my environment, I imported my data from Kaggle and unzipped it.
The book recommendation system I shall create will recommend books to users based on collaborative filtering which considers user behavior and similar user interests.
Process pipeline: Data --> Analysis --> Preprocessing --> Clustering Model --> Web app --> Deploy to cloud --> Heroku
