FIRST PROJECT EXPERIENCE
I had a series of hassles getting my environment right on VS Code, but Augustine came to my rescue.

After successfully setting my environment, I imported my data from Kaggle and unzipped it.
The book recommendation system I shall create will recommend books to users based on collaborative filtering which considers user behavior and similar user interests.
Process pipeline: Data --> Analysis --> Preprocessing --> Clustering Model --> Web app --> Deploy to cloud --> Heroku

I converted my data from csv to dataframe, then removed unneeded columns, and renamed some columns for easier convention.
Filtered users to those who have read more than 200 books, and filtered books to those that have 50 or more rating count.
Created a book pivot that consists of unique user IDs and book titles.
